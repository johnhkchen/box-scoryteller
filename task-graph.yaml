    title: Story Priority and Institutional Voice
    description: |-
      The specialist pipeline (S-003) produces triggers, context interviews, and narrative angles. But when an SID has five games on a single night, every game gets treated equally — same depth of analysis, same effort in the prompt. The system lacks a sense of "what matters tonight" and doesn't reflect the specific voice of the athletic department producing the content.

      This story addresses two gaps: helping SIDs see which games deserve attention before writing starts, and injecting institutional voice so outputs feel like they came from this program, not a generic sports AI.

    title: Box Score Data Pipeline
    description: Build an ingestion pipeline that collects and stores a year's worth of basketball box score data for testing and development. This provides realistic test data for the specialist prompts and ensures the parsing and analysis functions work across diverse game scenarios.
