Kianna Melvin led the charge with three goals on five shots, while Sophia Cooper matched her with three goals on four attempts.

While CLU managed 22 shots compared to the Matadors' 33, their conversion rate suffered as they found the back of the net just five times. Aleaha Gonzalez provided the lone bright spot for the home team, scoring four of CLU's five goals on a perfect 4-of-5 shooting performance.",
      "Defensively, CSUN's balanced approach paid dividends. The Matadors maintained superior field position by winning the sprint battle 4-0 and played cleaner water polo, committing just nine exclusions compared to CLU's 13. This discipline allowed them to maintain consistent offensive pressure while limiting the Sea Kings' scoring opportunities.",
      "Between the pipes, CLU's goalkeeping tandem of Izzy de Souza and Sophie Raquel combined for 13 saves but couldn't stem the tide of CSUN's relentless attack. De Souza made 10 saves in 24 minutes of action, while Raquel added three stops in limited duty."
