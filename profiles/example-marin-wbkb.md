## Practical Guidelines

### 10. Any names or terms to always use (or avoid)?

*Preferred terminology, nicknames, or things to never say. Examples: "We're the Mariners, not Marin" or "Never call us a junior college."*

> We are the Mariners, not "Marin." Always say "College of Marin" or "COM," never "junior college" or "JC" — we're a community college. Use "student-athlete" rather than just "player" when possible, as it emphasizes the full experience.

## Additional Context

*Anything else the narrative engine should know about your program, this season, or your communication style?*

> This season we're rebuilding with a young roster. Several players are first-generation college students. Our coach emphasizes development over wins, though we compete hard every game. Content should celebrate effort and growth as much as victories.
